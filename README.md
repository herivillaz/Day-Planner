This project was made taking in consideration the following requirements in Columbia Coding Boot Camp:

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

* When the user clicks the Button SAVE the event, whatever he typed in the text area keeps in local storage, even if he refresh the page.

* No project comes without its own set of difficulties and issues. There were a few things I had issues with along the way. It took me some time to be sure I stepped on each element. To Apply the local storage was the most challenging part.
* Hope you enjoy my project. Click and Trust my Day Planner Scheduler.
* I would appreciate your feedback to make this better. Thank You.
